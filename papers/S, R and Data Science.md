# S, R and Data Science
Paper available at [ACM Digital Library][1]

R language was developed to be an open source version of S language.
S is a software written by Bell Labs for data and statistical analysis purposes.
But S was not written to be a DSL, instead of, it was written as a part of a
data analysis project.
Then R replicate the most of implementation decisions from S, but being an open
source DSL.

## 1 - Introduction
R implements the same functionalities of S implementing some new ideias.
The main goals of S are:
1. Provide an interactive analysis using the best methods available.
2. Use dedicated data structure designed for data analysis purposes,
instead of basic types (like numbers, strings, etc).

The Bell Labs is the precursor of what we know as "Data Science" today.
After that name, it was recognized as "data analysis".

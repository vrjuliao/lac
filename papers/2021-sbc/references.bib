abstract = {Iterative optimization is a simple but powerful approach that searches the best possible combination of compiler optimizations for a given workload. However, iterative optimization is plagued by several practical issues that prevent it from being widely used in practice: a large number of runs are required to find the best combination, the optimum combination is dataset dependent, and the exploration process incurs significant overhead that needs to be compensated for by performance benefits. Therefore, although iterative optimization has been shown to have a significant performance potential, it seldom is used in production compilers.In this article, we propose iterative optimization for the data center (IODC): we show that the data center offers a context in which all of the preceding hurdles can be overcome. The basic idea is to spawn different combinations across workers and recollect performance statistics at the master, which then evolves to the optimum combination of compiler optimizations. IODC carefully manages costs and benefits, and it is transparent to the end user. To bring IODC to practice, we evaluate it in the presence of co-runners to better reflect real-life data center operation with multiple applications co-running per server. We enhance IODC with the capability to find compatible co-runners along with a mechanism to dynamically adjust the level of aggressiveness to improve its robustness in the presence of co-running applications.We evaluate IODC using both MapReduce and compute-intensive throughput server applications. To reflect the large number of users interacting with the system, we gather a very large collection of datasets (up to hundreds of millions of unique datasets per program), for a total storage of 16.4TB and 850 days of CPU time. We report an average performance improvement of 1.48 \texttimes{} and up to 2.08 \texttimes{} for five MapReduce applications, and 1.12 \texttimes{} and up to 1.39 \texttimes{} for nine server applications. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that IODC is effective in the presence of co-runners, improving performance by greater than 13% compared to the worst possible co-runner schedule.},

abstract = {A large number of compiler optimizations are nowadays available to users. These optimizations interact with each other and with the input code in several and complex ways. The sequence of application of optimization passes can have a significant impact on the performance achieved. The effect of the optimizations is both platform and application dependent. The exhaustive exploration of all viable sequences of compiler optimizations for a given code fragment is not feasible. As this exploration is a complex and time-consuming task, several researchers have focused on Design Space Exploration (DSE) strategies both to select optimization sequences to improve the performance of each function of the application and to reduce the exploration time. In this article, we present a DSE scheme based on a clustering approach for grouping functions with similarities and exploration of a reduced search space resulting from the combination of optimizations previously suggested for the functions in each group. The identification of similarities between functions uses a data mining method that is applied to a symbolic code representation. The data mining process combines three algorithms to generate clusters: the Normalized Compression Distance, the Neighbor Joining, and a new ambiguity-based clustering algorithm. Our experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach address the exploration of optimization sequences in the context of the ReflectC compiler, considering 49 compilation passes while targeting a Xilinx MicroBlaze processor, and aiming at performance improvements for 51 functions and four applications. Experimental results reveal that the use of our clustering-based DSE approach achieves a significant reduction in the total exploration time of the search space (20\texttimes{} over a Genetic Algorithm approach) at the same time that considerable performance speedups (41\% over the baseline) were obtained using the optimized codes. Additional experiments were performed considering the LLVM compiler, considering 124 compilation passes, and targeting a LEON3 processor. The results show that our approach achieved geometric mean speedups of 1.49 \texttimes{} , 1.32 \texttimes{} , and 1.24 \texttimes{} for the best 10, 20, and 30 functions, respectively, and a global improvement of 7\% over the performance obtained when compiling with -O2.},
